# Engineering-Data-Science
This repository summarizes my projects during learning Statistics and Data Science for Engineers, including stochastic gradient descent, singular value decomposition, principle components analysis, K-means clustering, KNN Classification, logistic regression classifier, and ensemble classification models(SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosted Trees).   

**I am still in progress of taking courses of Statistics and Data Science for Engineers.**
