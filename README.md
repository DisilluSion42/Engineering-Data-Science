# Engineering-Data-Science
This repository summarizes my projects during learning Statistics and Data Science for Engineers, including stochastic gradient descent, singular value decomposition, principle components analysis, and K-means clustering. *Each project has been assigned a branch.*      

**I am still in progress of taking courses of Statistics and Data Science for Engineers.**
